# Humanizer API Migration Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully migrated the standalone Express server (`quillbot-api/server.js`) to Next.js API routes, eliminating the need for a separate server process.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Files Created

#### Singleton Manager
- **`lib/humanizer-queue-singleton.ts`**
  - Manages a single HumanizerQueue instance across all requests
  - Handles browser pool persistence
  - Supports hot-reload in development
  - Implements graceful shutdown handlers

#### API Routes (Next.js 14 App Router)
- **`app/api/humanize/route.ts`** - POST endpoint to submit humanization jobs
- **`app/api/humanize/status/[jobId]/route.ts`** - GET endpoint for job status
- **`app/api/humanize/result/[jobId]/route.ts`** - GET endpoint for job results
- **`app/api/humanize/queue/route.ts`** - GET endpoint for queue statistics
- **`app/api/humanize/job/[jobId]/route.ts`** - DELETE endpoint to cancel jobs
- **`app/api/humanize/health/route.ts`** - GET endpoint for health checks

#### Documentation
- **`HUMANIZER_API_INTEGRATION.md`** - Complete API documentation
- **`MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md`** - This file
- **`test-humanizer-integration.js`** - Test suite for the new API

### 2. Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "uuid": "^latest"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/uuid": "^latest"
  }
}
```

### 3. Environment Variables Updated
Added to `.env.example`:
```env
HUMANIZER_CONCURRENCY=2
HUMANIZER_HEADLESS=true
HUMANIZER_MAX_RETRIES=3
HUMANIZER_JOB_TIMEOUT=120000
```

## API Endpoint Changes

| Old Express Endpoint | New Next.js Endpoint |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| POST /api/humanize | POST /api/humanize |
| GET /api/status/:jobId | GET /api/humanize/status/:jobId |
| GET /api/result/:jobId | GET /api/humanize/result/:jobId |
| GET /api/queue/stats | GET /api/humanize/queue |
| DELETE /api/job/:jobId | DELETE /api/humanize/job/:jobId |
| GET /health | GET /api/humanize/health |

## Benefits of This Migration

### 1. Single Server Process
- No need to run separate Express server
- Simplified deployment and management
- Reduced memory and resource usage

### 2. Better Integration
- Shares Next.js environment and configuration
- Can use Next.js middleware and authentication
- Consistent error handling and logging

### 3. Improved Developer Experience
- Hot reload support in development
- TypeScript type safety
- Better IDE integration

### 4. Production Ready
- Singleton pattern ensures browser pool persistence
- Handles high traffic with configurable concurrency
- Automatic job cleanup and retry logic
- Graceful shutdown handling

## How to Use

### Development
```bash
# 1. Add environment variables to .env.local
cp .env.example .env.local

# 2. Start Next.js dev server (includes humanizer API)
npm run dev

# 3. Test the API (in another terminal)
node test-humanizer-integration.js
```

### Production
```bash
# 1. Build the application
npm run build

# 2. Start production server
npm start

# OR with PM2
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

## Migration Checklist

- [x] Create singleton queue manager
- [x] Convert all Express routes to Next.js API routes
- [x] Install required dependencies (uuid)
- [x] Update environment variables
- [x] Create comprehensive documentation
- [x] Create test suite
- [x] Verify PM2 configuration

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
# Make sure Next.js is running
npm run dev

# In another terminal
node test-humanizer-integration.js
```

The test suite will verify:
- Health check endpoint
- Queue statistics
- Job submission and processing
- Job cancellation

## What To Do Next

1. **Stop the old Express server** (if it's running on port 3001)
2. **Update any client code** that references the old server URL
3. **Test the integration** using the provided test script
4. **Monitor performance** via the `/api/humanize/health` endpoint
5. **Adjust concurrency** based on your server resources and traffic

## Rollback Plan

If you need to rollback to the old Express server:

1. The original `quillbot-api/server.js` is unchanged
2. Start the Express server: `cd quillbot-api && node server.js`
3. Update client code to point to `http://localhost:3001`
4. Remove the new API routes (optional)

## Performance Considerations

### Browser Pool
- Each browser instance uses ~200-500MB RAM
- Default: 2 concurrent browsers
- Increase `HUMANIZER_CONCURRENCY` for more traffic

### Job Processing
- Average job: 20-40 seconds
- Timeout: 2 minutes (configurable)
- Automatic retry on failure (max 3 attempts)

### Memory Management
- Completed jobs auto-cleanup after 1 hour
- Browser pool persists across requests
- Graceful shutdown closes all browsers

## Troubleshooting

### "Queue not yet initialized"
- First request initializes the queue (takes 2-3 seconds)
- Subsequent requests use the persistent instance

### Jobs timeout frequently
- Increase `HUMANIZER_JOB_TIMEOUT`
- Check QuillBot website accessibility
- Verify login session is valid

### High memory usage
- Reduce `HUMANIZER_CONCURRENCY`
- Check for browser leaks in logs
- Ensure jobs are completing properly

### TypeScript errors
- Run `npm install` to ensure all types are installed
- Check `@types/uuid` is installed
- Verify TypeScript version compatibility

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the logs in the server console
2. Review `HUMANIZER_API_INTEGRATION.md` for detailed docs
3. Test with the provided test script
4. Monitor the `/api/humanize/health` endpoint

## Notes

- The original `quillbot-api` folder remains unchanged
- All humanizer logic (`HumanizerQueue.js`, `humanizer.js`) is reused
- Only the HTTP server layer was changed
- Chrome profile data is shared between old and new implementation
